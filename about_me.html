        Hello, My Name is Johann Martinez-Garcia, I am 18 years old, and I am a senior at Phillip O Berry. I am from Charlotte, North Carolina and I was born here. My hobbies are playing sports like soccer & football. I also like playing video games like apex, halo, and call of duty. A fun fact about myself is that I was born in a BMW 323i.

    Right now I am attending Phillip o Berry and my favorite subject at the moment is weight lifting and cardio. After high school I will begin learning how to start a business on my own so I would get a head start on my dream. CPCC is the college I want to attend since it is cheap and easy. I want to major in Business & Finance, Accounting, and Retail. In 10 years, I will be running my own business and a step closer to becoming a billionare.
